A Communication System in Chrome extension for a [tutorial](https://scotch.io/@dongido/how-to-build-a-communication-system-in-google-chrome-extensions-using-pusher) I made.

## How to Install

Download or clone the repository. If it's a zip file, extract it to a folder.

  1. Copy `chrome://extensions` to the browser address bar and press enter.

  2. Click the Load unpacked extension button. A file dialog will appear.

  3. In the file dialog, choose the directory where the files are stored. Unless you get an error dialog, you've now installed the app. 

  4. Click the icon for the app.(Viola!, we just launched our new extension!).
  
## To start the server
   
  > :bulb: This app uses a PHP server which I have written in PHP

  1. Open your command prompt.
  
  2. Navigate into the server folder.
  
  3. Execute the command: 
  
  ```sh
     php -S localhost:9020 message.php
  ````
